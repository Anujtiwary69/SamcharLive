"I don''t remember when this road was last repaired."<br /><br />Khan alleged that the outgoing legislator, Raushan Lal Verma of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), who has now joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), had always neglected their problems.&nbsp;<br /><br />Verma has been their representative for the last 10 years.<br /><br />Imran Khan, the muncipal body chairman in Tilhar, said the legislator "hasn''t done any work in the last 10 years".<br /><br />Khan said caste equations played a more important role in the execution of work by the MLA.&nbsp;<br /><br />"If we complain about lack of development, he would curtly tell us: ''Go to that person you voted for.'' He knows who voted for him and who didn''t."<br /><br />Sumit Kumar Singh, another co-passenger in the auto-rickshaw, said Verma would question visitors whom they voted for in the previous election.<br /><br />Ironically, the issue of better roads don''t seem to find mention in the high voltage electioneering in the constituency, where the main contest appears to be between the two-time MP and Congress leader Jitin Prasada and BJP''s Verma.&nbsp;<br /><br />The BSP is also in the race but is running, by popular account, at the third spot.

The notion of service must prevail to ensure quality healthcare for the public, they said.<br /><br />However, caregivers also pointed out the dichotomy between making things cheaper and giving the best because, as technology improves, so does the cost.<br /><br />"I think patients must feel that whatever is being charged is appropriate and the system must allow the patient to have the confidence that what''s been charged is correct," Mammen Chandy, Director, Tata Medical Centre, Kolkata, told IANS.<br /><br />Chandy, a celebrated bone marrow transplant expert, however believes that if the notion of medicine as a service had endured, people wouldn''t have had so much to complain about.<br /><br />"As medical people, we mustn''t want to earn too much. People must not invest in medicine as a profit-making business. If medicine remained a service, then the public wouldn''t have this difficulty," he noted.<br /><br />Veteran surgical gastroenterologist and liver transplant surgeon Samiran Nundy, who had kicked up a debate in a 2014 editorial on corruption in healthcare in India in the British Medical Journal, batted for a "radical change".<br /><br />Nundy believes India needs not-for-profit set-ups rather than corporate hospitals.<br /><br />"You don''t allow corporate hospitals or they should be not-for-profit. There should be an interest in academics. The best hospitals in the US are not-for-profit," Nundy, of New Delhi''s Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said.&nbsp;<br /><br />Offering insights into running a not-for-profit establishment, Chandy referred to CMC Vellore, where he had led the bone marrow transplant service.<br /><br />"A private patient pays twice what it costs a general patient. Why? The hospital has to run and therefore it''s a non-profit and because it''s a non-profit whatever is generated from the income goes towards expansion, which means that you need replacement equipment and so on," Chandy explained.<br /><br />But he emphasised that one can cut corners to make things cheaper but to offer the best, the cost escalates.<br /><br />"Modern medicine is expensive and as technology increases and improves, cost increases and if you want to do something properly it will be expensive," Chandy said.<br /><br />But can doctors stay honest given the increasing corporatisation of the medical profession?<br /><br />This concern was raised by Chief Minister Banerjee as she accused a string of prominent hospitals of "unethical money-making", subsequently announcing a regulatory body to monitor their activities.<br /><br />She had said doctors are forced to bend to the will of management of private hospitals for commissions.<br /><br />Nundy''s observation on the patchy, under-funded and overcrowded public hospitals stretches to the contrasting work culture where doctors in corporate hospitals have to justify fat pay cheques compared to public servants who are rather "secure".<br /><br />"... the doctors (in public hospitals) are overworked or very lazy and they have secure government jobs. In the private sector there are many corporate hospitals and they have to churn out profits and many doctors are given big salaries and they have to justify their salaries," he said.<br /><br />But as medical ethics begin sliding down a slippery slope, it is crucial to rein in the resulting malpractice.<br /><br />"In Britain any malpractice goes to the General Medical Council which is very firm and strikes doctors off. In India the Medical Council of India (MCI) is very corrupt and very rarely takes measures. We need to strengthen the MCI, make it smaller, with half the people doctors and half the people the lay public," Nundy stressed.<br /><br />He proposed something on the lines of Obamacare "where the poor get a certain basic level of treatment".<br /><br />"If you want more complicated treatment you need to have health insurance and if you can''t afford health insurance, then the state will pay the insurance for you," he said.&nbsp;<br /><br />Bengal''s Director of Health Services B.R. Satpathy believes that at the micro level, there is need for coordination between private and state-run healthcare.<br /><br />"With the regulatory commission we will try to achieve coordination and supervision so no patient is left out from getting the right treatment," Satpathy added.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Credit : &nbsp;Sahana Ghosh</strong></p>', '2017-02-28 09:39:09', '', 22, '', ''),

Years later, a cartoonist turned it into the party''s mascot.<br /><br />Now, instead of the firebrand on the campaign trail, it was a very presidential Trump who in much "softer" and "milder" tones outlined in his first address to the US Congress how he would write the "new chapter of American Greatness."<br /><br />The outsider-turned-Republican offered a new, improved healthcare plan to replace "Obamacare," his predecessor''s "collapsing" signature healthcare law, a trillion dollar investment in infrastructure, tax and trade reforms and a merit-based immigration system.<br /><br />As Democratic lawmakers with many of the women in suffragist white greeted him with silence to protest his alleged sexist stance, the President spoke of his joint efforts with Canada to help women entrepreneurs "live out their financial dreams."<br /><br />Trump also vowed to "create a level playing field for American companies and workers", give them protection and "free the dreams of our people."<br />Even as he promised to issue a tamped-down executive order to ban travel from seven terror-prone Muslim majority nations, he hinted at offering a pathway to legal status to some 11 million undocumented immigrants, including some 350,000 from India, while throwing the bad dudes out.<br /><br />With their progressive donkey stolen by the brash billionaire, Democrats did not know whether to applaud or to continue their resistance to all things Trump in sullen silence.<br /><br />Basking in the afterglow of rare media approval, Trump, who in a Fox News interview had given himself an "A" for his achievements so far and a "C or C+" for messaging, decided to give his ever-twitching thumbs some rest.<br /><br />But the going was too good to last as a media report of two undisclosed meetings during the presidential campaign between his Attorney General and then Senator Jeff Sessions and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak resurrected the Russian red herring.<br /><br />With the new controversy threatening to claim his second cabinet nominee the same way as his first, National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, Trump finally broke twitter silence to come to the defence of his long-time supporter.<br /><br />"For precisely four days, eight hours and five minutes -- That''s 6,245 consecutive minutes!" -- the President had "refrained from tweeting anything inflammatory", according to the Washington Post.<br /><br />Calling the "whole narrative (is) a way of saving face for Democrats losing an election that everyone thought they were supposed to win", he branded the opposition''s calls for Sessions'' resignation a total "witch hunt!"<br /><br />Even as Sessions recused himself from any investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the US presidential election to help Trump, the President fired off tweets at the Democratic Senate and House Minority leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi.<br /><br />"We should start an immediate investigation into @SenSchumer and his ties to Russia and Putin. A total hypocrite!" he wrote with a 2003 picture of Schumer having a friendly doughnut and coffee with Russian President Vladimir Putin.<br /><br />"I hereby demand a second investigation, after Schumer, of Pelosi for her close ties to Russia, and lying about it," Trump tweeted over a 2010 picture of Pelosi sitting with the Russian envoy and other officials.<br /><br />"Happily talk re: my contact w Mr. Putin &amp; his associates, took place in ''03 in full view of press &amp; public under oath," shot back the Democrat asking POTUS, "Would you &amp; your team?"<br /><br />Meanwhile, as Trump reportedly planned to slash the budget of the Environment Protection Agency by 25 percent, his Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke came to office riding an Irish sports horse, with a promise to provide more resources to National Parks.<br /><br />Amid this political theatre of the absurd, Sunday''s Oscar goof-up with "La La Land" first getting the Best Picture award only to lose it to "Moonlight" moments later, turned into a viral social media meme.<br /><br />"Amazing ending.

The ratio has remained consistent in the last three years and is an improvement by about four per cent since 2010. And, only 71 female teachers figure among the total of 620.<br /><br />"Unfortunately, the progress and advancement of women makes society uncomfortable even today. A woman with an opinion and a strong personality is oftentimes looked down upon. A change in this trend is only possible if the perception of women is changed in the society at large and inculcated at a young age in boys and girls," Swagata Dasgupta, Associate Dean, Continuing Education Programme at IIT-Kharagpur, told IANS.<br /><br />Asked about her personal challenges, the veteran faculty member said that at the early stages of her career, she sometimes felt "women with voice and opinion are not appreciated".<br /><br />"The scenario has no doubt changed over the years, but still persists to a lesser degree," the acclaimed academician added.<br /><br />Poonam Gupta, alumnus and entrepreneur, who defines herself as a "go-getter", debunks the myth that women shy away from hard work. For her, one of the major challenges that women face, not just in STEM, but almost everywhere in society, is the outlook of people towards them.<br /><br />"They are usually more hard-working than men because they usually have to work twice as hard to get the same recognition or pay," Gupta, the co-founder &amp; CEO of Alive Home Technologies Private Limited, told IANS.<br /><br />The company, incubated at IIT''s Science and Technology Entrepreneurs'' Park (STEP), is working towards emart electrification at the institute.<br /><br />As women dig in their heels deeper, often in male bastions, Gupta reiterates there is still a long way to go.<br /><br />Asked about IITs, Dasgupta, a highly cited researcher, stressed that premier institutes are "not isolated islands".<br /><br />"The solution has to come from the wider population. IITs need to take proactive measures, for example, recruit more women faculty, promote women to positions of responsibility and create a conducive environment for students and faculty," Dasgupta explained.<br /><br />Nandini Bhandaru, recipient of the Young Scientist Award (Indian Science Congress, 2016), believes that the scenario is already changing.<br /><br />"Our lab has more female PhD students than males. And together we make a great team," Bhandaru, an alumnus of the Department of Chemical Engineering, told IANS.<br /><br />However, she laid strong emphasis for women to keep their eyes on the prize.<br /><br />"The girls need to focus. They must start believing in themselves, take responsibility, have a big, grand picture ... you just cannot stand at the side, always seeking help from a male colleague to fix up a gas cylinder, or can''t always refuse to come down to the lab to collect data at the middle of the night, if need be. I think IITs do offer that security to us, and girls out here should make the best of it, rather than spending their time on trivialities," Bhandaru elaborated.<br /><br />So are there enough chances for women?<br /><br />"It is not entirely true that there are less opportunities -- but in order to avail of these opportunities a woman faces additional hurdles in the form of societal prejudice, family pressure and a need to conform to the stereotypes," Dasgupta clarified.<br /><br />"Women must not feel the stress associated with trying to prove oneself over and over again as they tend to have a more &lsquo;feeling guilty'' syndrome. A supportive environment will definitely make adjustments easier."<br /><br />Gupta and Bhandaru are clear about one thing: women don''t need favours.<br /><br />"I don''t think, we need pity, favours, and concessions. We need equal rights and opportunities. This is my definition of feminism," Gupta asserted.<br /><br />"I always believe that I need no concession or special scheme to make it to the top. I rely on my confidence and skills, and that''s enough," Bhandaru signed-off.<br /><br />(Sahana Ghosh can be contacted at sahana.g@ians.in)</p>', '2017-03-08 07:36:29', '', 8, '', ''),

This is the first time since he started practising active politics in the 1960s that the Yadav chieftain largely missed a campaign.<br /><br />Completely sidelined this time by his son and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, who edged him out as President of the SP, Mulayam had addressed some 100 rallies in the 2012 assembly polls. Shivpal Singh Yadav, who until not long ago was the number two in the party and its chief strategist, had no work this time around. He was neither invited nor did he go anywhere to campaign for party workers.<br /><br />The other first from the first family of Uttar Pradesh was the public statements by Mulayam''s second wife Sadhna Gupta, who, just hours before the last round in Poorvanchal, gave an hour-long interview to a TV news agency, alleging slight and saying that Akhilesh should not have humiliated &lsquo;Neta-ji''. Largely in the background over the past two decades, this was Sadhna''s first outing in public.<br /><br />It was also for the first time that the Yadav clan stepped out of Saifai to contest state elections. While most members of the Mulayam clan are from in and around the Saifai belt, this time nephew Anurag Yadav was fielded from Sarojininagar and, of course, Aparna Yadav from Lucknow Cantt.<br /><br />The state polls also had a first in the fact that Sonia Gandhi''s daughter Priyanka Vadra figured in the list of all phases as a star campaigner though she obliged with just one rally in Rae Bareli, her mother''s Lok Sabha constituency. It was also the first time that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, or for that matter any Prime Minister, spent so much time and energy on a state assembly election.<br /><br />At the end of the seven-phase polls, Modi had addressed 23 mega rallies and had done two roadshows. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President Amit Shah also got into the "first list" by addressing 210 rallies.<br /><br />It was, incidentally, also the first time that BJP veterans L.K. Advani and Kanpur MP Murli Manohar Joshi did not hit the campaign trail. Once the faces of all BJP campaigns, they were a complete washout in the Uttar Pradesh polls this time.<br /><br />Sheila Dixit, the former Delhi Chief Minister, who was pitched as the "UP bahu" and the presumptive Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister before the Congress struck an alliance with the SP, was also nowhere to be seen during the campaign.<br /><br />For the state police, there were many firsts too. Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) Daljeet Chowdhary said there were "highest seizures of unaccounted money, illicit liquor and illegal vehicles" during the campaign. The state police seized almost Rs 40 crore of the total Rs 119.42 crores of illegal cash caught during elections.<br /><br />A staggering 2.23 million bulk litres of liquor, costing a whopping Rs 64.17 crore, was seized and 3.62 million people were booked under various sections of the IPC and of the warrants issued against 22,400 people, 21,653 were served. Police also undertook a mammoth task on depositing 870,000 licensed weapons.<br /><br />"The experience of conducting smooth elections is satisfying," a senior official told IANS, while pointing out that despite a huge influx of VVIPs, there was no untoward incident. Intelligence officials concede that the road shows undertaken by Modi in an open SUV in Varanasi and another SPG protectee, Rahul Gandhi, in Meerut, Agra, Allahabad, Varanasi and Lucknow were "security nightmares". But now that all has ended well, they have heaved a sigh of relief.<br /><br />Deputy Election Commissioner Umesh Singh, while talking to IANS on phone from New Delhi, said there were many firsts for the poll panel too during the Uttar Pradesh elections. "Many first-time initiatives were undertaken by the state CEO -- like launch of many mobile applications for helping voters and a grievance redressal portal," he informed.<br /><br />Incidentally, it was for the first time that a suspected terrorist was killed in a gun battle on the day of polling -- the last phase in Poorvanchal -- on March 8.</p>', '2017-03-10 07:15:30', 'image/Vote.jpg', 4, 'y', ''),
